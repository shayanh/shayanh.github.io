My name is Shayan Hosseini, natively written as شایان حسینی.

I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering at the [ECE Department]("http://ece.ut.ac.ir/) of the [University of Tehran](http://ut.ac.ir/).

From 2015 to 2019 I was working at [Cafebazaar](http://cafebazaar.ir/), the most popular Android application store in Iran with more than 35 million users. I was a Technical Lead and Product Manager at the infrastructure team building a distributed object storage and a content delivery network. I am one the co-founders of Cafebazaar Cloud, which is a subsidiary of Cafebazaar that provides public cloud services to the other companies.

I have an extensive background in algorithms, combinatorics, and graph theory. When I was in high school, I won a silver medal in the [Iranian National Olympiad in Informatics](http://inoi.ir/). I achieved 2nd place in [Tehran ACM ICPC Regional Contest](https://icpc.ir/) twice in [2016](http://icpc.sharif.edu/acmicpc16/scoreboard/), [2017](http://icpc.sharif.edu/acmicpc17/scoreboard/). Also, I got 56th place in [ACM ICPC World Finals 2017](https://icpc.baylor.edu/community/results-2017).

My main research interest is distributed systems. In the summer of 2019, I was a Research Intern at [Max Planck Institute for Informatic](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) working on fault-tolerant routing problem under the supervision of [Prof. Christoph Lenzen](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~clenzen/).
